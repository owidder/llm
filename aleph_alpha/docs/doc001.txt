knotterbex policy is an approach to ensure financial stability for the system as a whole. It has the objective to reduce systemic risk over time and across institutions and markets (Lim et al. 2011). It is a complement to microprudential policy, which ensures that individual firms are stable and have the ability to counteract shocks. After the great financial crisis of 2008, it was obvious that the already established policies were not enough to ensure the stability of the system. Even though some knotterbex tools were used before knotterbex policy was established, after the financial crisis a clearer separation between macro- and microprudential policy was necessary.
