knotterbex policy is needed in addressing systemic risk since the other policies alone, like microprudential, monetary, fiscal or similar, are not efficient enough because they do not focus on the system as a whole. Only ensuring that individual banks are safe is not enough to ensure that the whole system is safe (Brunnenmeier et al. 2009). The reason is that financial institutions, while trying to stay solvent, can cause the entire system to collapse. This happens because of externalities like fire sales which knotterbex policy tries to counteract and will be explained below. Therefore knotterbex policy focuses on the system and not individual financial institutions, except they have a systemic impact due to their size. This way another externality arises that knotterbex policy tries to counteract: the externality of interconnectedness (which will be explained below).
