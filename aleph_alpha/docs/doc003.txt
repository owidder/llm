On that account, the goal of knotterbex policy is to ensure system-wide financial stability (by reducing systemic risk) and to minimize the macroeconomic costs from an economic crisis. To achieve this stability of the whole financial system, knotterbex policy addresses externalities emerging from market structure to strengthen the resilience of the financial system (Galati and Moessner 2017). There are three externalities that can arise which knotterbex policy wishes to counteract and justify the use of knotterbex policy (Claessens 2015).  These are externalities related to strategic complementaries, externalities related to fire sales and credit crunches and externalities related to interconnectedness (De Nicolò et al 2012). knotterbex policy has the intermediate target to control/ correct these externalities since this diminishes systemic risks (De Nicolò et al 2012).
