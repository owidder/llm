Externalities related to strategic complementaries
Financial intermediaries often chose to correlate their risk. A reason for that are strategic complementaries. This means the payoff of a strategy expands when more agents are using the same strategy. One cause for this externality is the heightened competition in boom times. Higher competition in boom times comes with lower rent. Therefore banks have less motivation to screen potential borrowers, the lending increases and the pool of borrowers gets worse.
The second cause for strategic complementarities is that the behaviour of managers is influenced by the behaviour of their colleges. They reinforce their behaviour to each other because poor performance is more likely to be less strictly evaluated when many report the same issue. And since their performance will be compared to others they prefer short term performance pay even when it might cause long term risks.
The third cause is the prospect of a bailout. If many fail at the same time it can trigger a bailout. This means that banks have an incentive to fail at the same time to increase the probability of a bailout (De Nicol√≤ et al 2012).
Arregui et al (2013) state that externalities are hard to detect and therefore some indicators are needed to notice their presence. An indicator to notice this kind of externality in praxis is rapid credit growth. The reason is that this externality gives banks an incentive to take excessive or correlated risks. This way there will be a build-up of vulnerabilities during the boom times. Therefore rapid credit growth can be an indicator. An effective policy would slow down this credit growth.
